Agentic AI for Advanced Calculation to Support LLMs
Overview

This project introduces an agentic AI system designed to dynamically use external tools for performing advanced calculations that enhance large language model (LLM) reasoning capabilities.
The agent can decide, based on the task and context, which computational tools to invoke in order to assist the LLM in solving complex problems beyond its native capabilities.
Key Features

    Dynamic Tool Usage: The agent selects and calls the appropriate tool at runtime based on the LLM's needs.

    Advanced Calculations: Supports complex mathematical operations, data transformations, and custom calculations.

    LLM Integration: Extends LLM abilities by outsourcing heavy computation tasks to specialized tools.

    Modular and Extensible: Easily plug in new tools or calculation modules without changing the core logic.

    Context-Aware Decision Making: The agent uses task context to reason about which tool to use.
